# Pitch Generator
Generates a random, meme-fuelled pitch about something that could possibly be interesting

Added Complexity: Expansion by replacing sections with entire phrases, with some requiring additional replacements <br/>
Artist statement: I wanted to make something inspired by all the different pitches of various forms of entertainment I've gotten from my friends. I swear, it's not that it's not interesting, I just haven't had time to check it out!
